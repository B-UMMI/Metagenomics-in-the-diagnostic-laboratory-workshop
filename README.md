## Overview

This practical session will introduce state-of-the art analysis of Illumina paired-end shotgun metagenomic data in the
context of the Diagnostic Laboratory. Participants will learn the basis of interaction with Linux Operating System 
with Shell commands through a terminal windows, and how to use the [Flowcraft](https://github.com/assemblerflow/flowcraft)
tool to build and execute pipelines to asses microbial composition, resistance gene detection and typing.

## Target audience

Participants of ESCMID's capacity-building workshop for Metagenomics in the Diagnostic Laboratory
